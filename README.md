## 📌 Project Overview
This project aims to design a system that evaluates muscle activity in patients with severe muscle impairment (e.g., unable to contract muscles in arms or legs) and determines whether rehabilitation has been successfully completed.

Surface EMG (sEMG) signals are measured to detect muscle contraction in real time.
When the measured signal exceeds a predefined threshold, an audio feedback is generated to notify that muscle contraction is successful.

&nbsp;

### 🎯 Goal
- Assess the recovery level of patients with weakened muscle function and provide intuitive feedback when a certain threshold is reached

- Evaluate rehabilitation potential in a non-invasive way to improve patient comfort and motivation

- Utilize bio-signal–based interface as an assistive communication or response trigger device
